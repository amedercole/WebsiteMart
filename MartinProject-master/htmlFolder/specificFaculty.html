                <h1><b>William F Martin</b></h1>
                <p>William F. Martin is an energy economist who has served as Executive Secretary of the National
                    Security Council, Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan and Deputy Secretary of the US
                    Department of Energy under President Reagan. He is also chairman of the Department of Energy’s
                    Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee and chairman of the Council on Foreign Relation’s Energy Security
                    Group for the past ten years. In 2006, he was elected President of the University for Peace of the
                    United Nations.
                </p>
                <p>Martin was educated at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School (BS, 1972) and Massachusetts
                    Institute of Technology (SM, 1974). His master’s thesis was the basis of an article he published in
                    the Harvard Business Review (“Our Society in 1985: Business may not like it, March 1975”). Following
                    graduation from MIT, he joined the MIT Energy Laboratory as Program Officer for the Workshop on
                    Alternative Energy Strategies. During his four years on the professional research staff of MIT, he
                    co-authored three books, Growth and Its Implications for the Future, (Roundtable Press, 1973),
                    Energy Supply to the Year 2000 (MIT Press, 1977) and Professional Materials for Environmental
                    Management Education (MIT Press, 1975).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following MIT, Martin was responsible for energy statistics for developing countries at the
                    International Energy Agency (OECD, Paris) and was part of a UN expert group that developed the
                    methodology for reporting United Nations energy statistics. In 1977, he was promoted to special
                    assistant to the Executive Director of IEA, Ulf Lantzke, and served in this capacity for three years
                    during the time of the second oil shock.

                    the Rising Sun in person from Emperor Akihito of Japan, and was commended by Czech President Vaclav
                    Havel for significant contributions to the Czech Republic. He received the highest honor of the
                    Department of Energy for contributions in the fields of energy security and science and technology
                    including fathering both the human genome project (1986) and international thermonuclear

                <p>At the risk of omitting a few of your accomplishments I can’t let this occasion pass without citing
                    some
                    of your specific achievements for the record. You played a pivotal role in urging the Europeans to
                    reduce their dependence on Soviet gas, and you were the principal draftsman of the Williamsburg
                    Economic
                    Summit Communique in l983. I recall with fondness your extraordinary roll in coordinating many
                    international events both in the Oval Office and on the road — in Korea, Japan, China, Canada and
                    throughout Europe. Then again you were at my side as Executive Secretary of the National Security
                    Council. In this capacity you played a crucial role as day-to-day operations manager of our national
                    security interests.</p>
